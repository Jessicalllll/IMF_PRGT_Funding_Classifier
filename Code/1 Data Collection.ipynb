The IMF provides various types of loans to all countries under different programs, from non-consessional to concessional. While all member countries have access to the General Resources Account for non-concessional loans (i.e. with an interest), the IMF does provide concessional loans (i.e. zero-interest loans) to low-income countries. The process of assessing which countries should receive such loans can be very time consuming since there are many aspects taken into account, so we believe it would be beneficial to build a model to predict if a country should be approved for receiving such loans by the IMF. If our model has a high accuracy, it would save time and money for the IMF to review all of the materials."],"metadata":{"id":"FUQBJUK-fX-9"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kNA0ygZQCXEB"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import datetime"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We first started with our data collection process by searching for data of what countries have received IMF fundings by year.

We found that there was a change of name in 2010, and the ESFs are simply the current RCF. After that, we checked the number of countries and number of records under each type of disbursement.

We first checked the timeframe of all records which is from 1985 to 2022, and checked the number of countries, which is 74. This is not so imbalanced given that there are 190 countries in the IMF. Finally we checked the accuracy of the baseline model, i.e. what percentage of countries and years have not received any funds. It turns out to be a little above 63%, which is acceptable.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"I5jIfwVibeOO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Factors"],"metadata":{"id":"-kla7C0NgIOO"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Extended credit facility (ECF) was the IMF’s main tool for supporting country needs, which is under Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). It is on a base-to-base basis to determine the country’s ability to access ECF, which is evaluated by the country's balance of payments need, the strength of its economic program and capacity to repay the Fund, the amount of outstanding Fund credit and the member’s record of past use of Fund credit. \n","\n","Reading the descriptions of IMF’s Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), both available to PRGT-eligible countries, we learned that they are meant to help with short-term financing needs caused by shocks. \n","\n","In conclusion, to determine whether or not a country should receive funds, we consider the following factors: balance of payments needs, strength of its economic program, capacity to repay the Fund, the amount of outstanding Fund credit, the member’s record of past use of Fund credit, and shocks.\n","\n","The Balance of Payments (BOP) refers to the statistical data of transactions made between a specific country and the rest of the world. The current account balance refers to the nation’s trade in goods and services while the capital account balance refers to transactions between financial institutions. By integrating these two parts as well as financial account balances and reserves, we can examine the economic activity of the nation with the rest of the world. \n","\n","A country's economic strength is an important factor that is measured by the IMF. This strength is typically reflected in a country's economic diversity (industry diversity, knowledgeable/high-tech or high-paid jobs), entrepreneurship (income per entrepreneur, entrepreneur density, start-up density), and growth (Real Income Per Capita, Real Income Growth, GDP growth). Most of the data related to economic diversity and entrepreneurship are hard to find, and the available data we get is incomplete with respect to time or country. For example, we can only find the number of start-up companies in the recent 5 years, and most of them are in developed countries. Also, features like Industry diversity are hard to quantify. After research, the final comprehensive and reliable dataset we find is the GDP growth (annual percent change); thus we use this feature to capture each country's economic strength.\n","\n","Capacity to repay the fund is hard to evaluate. It is related to a country’s government income (mainly tax), government spending, as well as political factors that may influence the stability of a country’s government and the government’s willingness to repay the fund. Plus, we didn’t find any well-formed data about this. Although the “Flows” section under the data query tool includes history of repayments and interests that might represent the capacity, we decided that these are not enough. After all, past repayments are not really representative of a country’s future capacity to repay the loans. Another reason we are not using it is that there should be some metrics to evaluate the historical repayments, like number of repayments, percentage of repayments, etc. However, this would require more research and data manipulation, so it doesn’t fit in the scope and time limit of our project.\n","\n","For the total PRG credit outstanding, we again used the IMF Financial Data Query Tool. We selected PRGT Credit Outstanding under position to download the total PRG credit outstanding for all countries and lenders from 1985 to 2022. \n","\n","The member’s record of past use of Fund credit is another useful factor that is used by the IMF. It demonstrates the behavior of the country when they were given funds in the past. However, since most of the record of past use of Fund credit is on a base-to-base basis on determining the ability to receive funds, we are not able to find all the data that demonstrate the member’s record of past use of Fund credit.\n","\n","There are many indicators of shocks, including natural disasters, food supplies, domestic instabilities, exogenous shocks, etc. While searching for data, we found that domestic instabilities and exogenous shocks were not easily quantifiable. We couldn’t find well-established data for our purpose, thus we chose only to use natural disasters and food supplies as features.\n","\n","For natural disaster data, we used EM-DAT: the international disasters database, which contains essential core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. We used the EM-DAT Query Tool to download natural disaster records for countries from 1985 to 2022.\n","\n","For food supply data, we used FAOSTAT, which is a database created by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. While it provides comprehensive data on every single kind of food, we decided to use the grand total Food Supply (kcal/capita/day) per year to represent the general food supply status, and we downloaded the data for countries from 1985 to 2019 from the website.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tsbootLAgJ9m"}}]}
