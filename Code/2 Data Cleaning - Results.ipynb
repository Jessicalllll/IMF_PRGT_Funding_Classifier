We first added a new column called “Year” from the Transaction Value Date and then selected only columns of country, year, and facility type. We then generated two dataframes of all countries and all years that have appeared in this dataset. We cross-joined them together so that each row corresponds to one country in a given year. After that, we merge with the original dataset to include the type of fund a country received in a year. We replaced null values with 0s, and any non-null values with 1s. In that way, we got an indicator of whether funds were received named “Fund”. Finally we kept only columns of country, year, and fund. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"xbjFTcn0iZdQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["flows = pd.read_csv('FLOWS
