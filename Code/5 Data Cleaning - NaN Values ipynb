For natural disasters, we didn’t find any explanations of missing values from the original source, but we speculate that missing values are simply 0s. This makes total sense because it’s extremely possible that a country didn’t experience any natural disasters in a year. We also checked the numbers of disasters near years that have missing values for a country, and confirmed that there are no big differences. Thus we decided to replace missing values with 0s.\n","\n","For total PRG credit outstanding, we also didn’t find official explanations. However, considering it’s totally fine if countries didn’t borrow money from the IMF before and probably some countries joined IMF later than our start year 1985, we also speculate that these missing values are 0s. We first confirmed that there are no missing values between years for any countries (i.e. all missing values are from the start for all countries). Similarly, we checked other countries with no missing values and observed that there are some 0s for the first several years for some countries. Thus we replaced null values with 0s.\n","\n","For all other columns with missing values, we observed that the values vary a lot across years and are not near 0. It doesn’t make sense to replace with 0 or mean values grouped by countries since these are already unstable economies. After confirming that dropping the missing values wouldn’t create a more imbalanced database, we just dropped all of the null values.
