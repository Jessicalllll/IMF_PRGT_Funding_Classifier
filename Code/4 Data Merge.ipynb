We first subtract 1 from the year of funds, since the decision is made based on data from the previous year instead of the current year (and also the data are not yet available). Then we first joined the GDP, before which we changed a country’s name to make them identical for joining and dropped a country that is not in the result dataset. We then joined the food supply, natural disasters, and total PGT credit outstanding data. Finally, we cleaned the country names of the current account balance, capital account balance, financial account balance, and reserves to match those of the result data, and joined them together.
